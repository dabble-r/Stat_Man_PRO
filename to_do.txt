9 - timestamp for league, team, player instances, and csv files - appended to file name - DONE
7 - refactor csv saving 
  *** mkdir for csv table files - folder name is timestamp
    *** if folder, base name, exists 
      *** prompt user to upsert table data or create new csv folder
  *** save each table as separate csv 
  *** retrieve csv files of same save session from Save/CSV folder 
  *** iterate over files in directory, load each as csv file reader, create instance in league and display
  *** prompt user to save on close 


Load CSV to league 
    * load button 
    * open load dialog 
    * select folder, not file 
    * prompt user to init new db or merge leagues
    * function iterates over csv files in folder, exclude sql sequence file 
    * depending on user input to prompt:
      * insert new data to empty league 
      * merge data to existing league
    
    * Update to GUI 
    * create class of Stack 
    * identify type of instance 
    * organize within class structure 
    * add to league 
      * create league 
      * create team 
        * add team to league
      * create player/pitcher 
        * add to team


Save CSV logic:
*** prevent multiple league isntance in League.db
  1 - user clicks on save button
  2 - save dialog shows 
  3 - save dialog - sets Saved/CSV dir path
  4 - user enters csv folder name (must enter folder name)
  5 - if no league DB exsits, init DB and populate DB
  5 - if CSV folder exists in Saved/CSV directory, prompt user to overwrite or create new folder
  6 - if user creates new folder, add timestamp to folder name
  7 - if user overwrites CSV folder, delete all CSV files in folder, save current CSV files from DB
